# an-ai-book-summarizer 📚🤖  
**Rami – Read, Analyze, Memorize, Interpret**

An experimental AI-powered book reader and summarizer built entirely using **GitHub Copilot**. I didn’t write a single line of code manually — the entire project was developed through AI suggestions, making this a unique exploration of how far Copilot can go in building usable tools.
